	  Generate code to prevent stack clash style attacks. When this
	  option is enabled, the compiler will only allocate one page of
	  stack space at a time and each page is accessed immediately after
	  allocation. Thus, it prevents allocations from jumping over any
	  stack guard page provided by the operating system.
